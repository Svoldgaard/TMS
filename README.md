🚛 Transport Management System
This is a hobby project I’m working on to explore different aspects of programming beyond what I learn in my CS degree. With 8.5 years of experience in the transport industry, I have firsthand knowledge of what a good transport management system needs—and what it doesn’t.

By combining my industry experience with programming, I aim to:
✅ Build a practical, efficient system for transport planning.
✅ Learn and apply new technologies.
✅ Improve my skills in software architecture, databases, and system design.

🛠️ Features (Planned & Implemented)
🚚 Transport planning & scheduling
📦 Order & shipment tracking
🗺️ Route optimization
📊 Analytics & reporting
🔐 User authentication & role management

🔧 Tech Stack
Jave (Javafx)
SQL (database)
CSS (Styling)

💡 Why This Project?
I used transport management systems extensively in my previous job, so I have a clear vision of what works well. This project helps me apply that knowledge while learning best practices in software development.
